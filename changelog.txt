Changes in version 1.6
======================

2009-08-13 markjh
 * Pick which JniExtractor to use by default based on what classloader is used to load NativeLoader

Changes in version 1.5
======================
2009-05-27 markjh
 * Move most of the functionality of DefaultJniExtractor to BaseJniExtractor
   with abstract getJniDir and getNativeDir.
 * Create WebappJniExtractor and move the support for multiple classloaders
   there. Update test to use this extractor.

2009-05-26 markjh
 * Add some more logging

2009-04-28 markjh
 * Remove unecessary forward slash in resource path

2009-04-24 maxb
 * Set source/target to Java 1.5.

2009-04-23 maxb
 * Make the temporary dir creation logic neater and embed a timestamp rather
   than randomness to enable the possibility of correlating timestamp with
   logs.
 * Undeprecate the old-style constructor, as it's perfectly valid to not want
   to bother specifying a classloader name in a single-classloader
   application.

2009-04-23 markjh
 * Care for backwards compatibility.
 * Use a temporary dir to extract jnilibs so apps don't have to specify a
   unique id.

2009-04-22 markjh
 * Support including native code for different architectures in the same
   application.
 * Make it possible for the native-loader to load the same jni library in
   different classloaders.
 * Create a new file to write into rather than overwriting the preexisting and
   possibly memory mapped file.

Changes in version 1.4
======================
2008-05-04 maxb
 * Add META-INF/lib/AUTOEXTRACT.LIST / extractRegistered() functionality.

Changes in version 1.3
======================
2008-04-25 richardv
 * Fix bug in DefaultJniExtractor.java which meant that JNI libs called
   *.jnilib (eg, on Darwin) weren't found. Thanks to 
   Javier Iglesias <javier.iglesias@unil.ch>.

Changes in version 1.2
======================
2008-03-26 richardv
 * Add changelog and license to source packages.

Changes in version 1.1
======================
2008-01-16 richardv
